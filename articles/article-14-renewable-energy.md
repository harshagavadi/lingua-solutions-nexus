Direct use applications of geothermal energy include district heating systems, greenhouse heating, industrial processes, and residential heating and cooling. These applications can significantly reduce energy costs and emissions in areas with accessible geothermal resources.

Enhanced geothermal systems (EGS) represent an emerging technology that could expand geothermal energy to areas without naturally occurring hydrothermal resources. EGS involves creating artificial reservoirs by injecting water into hot, dry rock formations and then extracting the heated water for energy production.

## Biomass Energy: Converting Organic Matter to Energy

Biomass energy involves converting organic materials into usable energy through various processes including combustion, gasification, and anaerobic digestion. Biomass can provide renewable energy while also helping to manage waste streams and support agricultural economies.

Biomass power plants burn organic materials like wood waste, agricultural residues, and dedicated energy crops to generate electricity. Modern biomass power plants use advanced combustion technologies and emissions controls to minimize environmental impacts.

Biogas production through anaerobic digestion converts organic waste into methane-rich gas that can be used for electricity generation, heating, or as a transportation fuel. This process also produces nutrient-rich digestate that can be used as fertilizer.

Biofuels, including ethanol and biodiesel, can replace fossil fuels in transportation applications. Advanced biofuels made from non-food feedstocks offer the potential for significant emissions reductions while avoiding competition with food production.

## Energy Storage: Enabling Renewable Energy Integration

Energy storage technologies are essential for maximizing the benefits of renewable energy by addressing the variability of sources like wind and solar. Storage systems can store excess energy when generation exceeds demand and release it when demand exceeds generation.

Battery storage systems, particularly lithium-ion batteries, have experienced dramatic cost reductions and performance improvements in recent years. These systems are increasingly being deployed alongside renewable energy projects to provide grid stability and enable higher levels of renewable energy integration.

Pumped hydro storage remains the largest form of grid-scale energy storage, using excess electricity to pump water uphill and generating electricity when the water flows back down. This technology provides long-duration storage and grid stability services.

Other storage technologies include compressed air energy storage, thermal energy storage, and hydrogen production through electrolysis. Each technology offers different characteristics in terms of storage duration, response time, and cost, making them suitable for different applications.
