                  Professional document translation requires adherence to rigorous quality standards and compliance frameworks. Understanding these standards ensures reliable, accurate translations that meet industry requirements.
                </p>

                <h2>International Translation Standards</h2>
                <p>
                  The translation industry operates under several international standards that define quality requirements, processes, and competencies. The most prominent is ISO 17100:2015, which specifies requirements for translation services and establishes a framework for quality management in translation projects.
                </p>

                <p>
                  ISO 17100 covers all aspects of the translation process, from project management and translator qualifications to revision procedures and client communication. Compliance with this standard ensures that translation services meet internationally recognized quality benchmarks.
                </p>

                <h2>ISO 17100:2015 Requirements</h2>

                <h3>Translator Competencies</h3>
                <p>
                  The standard defines specific competencies required for professional translators, including translation competence, linguistic and textual competence in both source and target languages, research competence, cultural competence, and technical competence.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Translators must possess appropriate qualifications, which may include formal education in translation, linguistics, or subject matter expertise combined with demonstrated translation experience. The standard also requires evidence of competence through professional certification or portfolio assessment.
                </p>

                <h3>Translation Process Requirements</h3>
